                <p>Security Systems Home Lab: I currently have an home lab consisting of a few switches, a PFsense network router and a VM running Security Onion SIEM. This is all used to monitor simualted network attacks I perform using a secondary Kali Linux VM to learn how network attacks work, how systems designed to prevent said attacks work, as well as indicators of compromise and experience operating a SIEM during an intrusion event</p>
                <p>Azure Cloud Resume: This webpage is also an ongoing project to showcase my skills in Azure Cloud. Check out my progress in the Cloud Resume Progress tab below!</p>

            <div class="subtext coll">
                <p>1. Certification: I am trying to obtain my Az-104 Ceritifcation over the Az-900 as it holds more value in showcasing my cloud skills. IN PROGRESS</p>
                <p>2. HTML: This website is written in HTML and CSS. It was initally created using templates, then edited to my use cases. DONE</p>
                <p>3. CSS: All styling is done via CSS overtop of HTML. DONE</p>
                <p>4. Static Website: This website is hosted as an Azure Static Web app which allows me to implement advanced features such as Azure Functions. DONE </p>
                <p>5. HTTPS: Azure Static Web Apps serve content using HTTPS by default allowing for secure transmission. DONE</p>
                <p>6. DNS: This website is hosted using Azure DNS configured to take requests from my domain wmbj.ca hosted on Web Hosting Canada This allows my custom URL to function correctly, www.wmbj.ca. DONE</p>
                <p>7. Javascript: I will later on attempt to create a tracker that displays the total number of users who have visited this site. The HTML page will use Java to pull that number from a back end Database. IN PROGRESS
                <p>8. Database: I have successfully created an Azure Function to update a database with an IP adress to record a logbook of who visits the website. However, this exposes an API via the front end. I will have to now split the website into a frontend and backend to securely do this. IN PROGRESS</p>
                <p>9. API: The Datbase is done via API calls, but from the front end currently. For security reasons I won't be exposing that yet. IN PROGRESS</p>
                <p>10. Python: An azure function is now written that commits the IP address of the connection to a database.  DONE</p>
                <p>11. Tests: Python code will support the use of Jest Test Cases. IN PROGRESS</p>
                <p>12. Infra as Code: All deployments are done via the repo changes for the website, or one click deploys from VS Code for the Azure Function. DONE</p>
