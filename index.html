                <p>Security Systems Home Lab: I currently have an home lab consisting of a few switches, a PFsense network router and a Virutal Machine running Security Onion SIEM. This is all used to monitor simualted network attacks I perform using a secondary Keli Linux VM to learn how network attacks work, how systems designed to prevent said attacks work, as well as indicator of compromise and experience operating a SIEM during an intrusion event</p>
        <p>Azure Cloud Resume: This webpage is also an ongoing project that is to showcase my skill in Azure Cloud. The outline is shown here. https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/azure/. Check out my progress in the Current Progress tab below!</p>

            <div class="subtext coll">
        <p>1. Certification: I am trying to obtain my Az-104 Ceritifcation over the Az-900 as it holds more value in showing my cloud skills. IN PROGRESS</p>
        <p>2. HTML: This website is written in HTML and CSS. It was initally created using templates, then edited to my use cases. DONE</p>
        <p>3. CSS: All styling is done via CSS overtop of HTML. DONE</p>
        <p>4. Static Website: This website is currently hosted using Azure blob storage then hosted from there. While this displays a working website, it does not allow for systems such as Azure Functions to operate. We will be migrating this website to an Azure Static Web app in the future. IN PROGRESS</p>
        <p>5. HTTPS: This website is hosted using HTTPS via an Azure Front Door CDN. The Front door has my custom domain linked to it directing all requests for www.wmbj.ca to my hosted azure site within blob storage. This allows for HTTPS connections and enhances security preventing them from directly accessing the blob storage. DONE</p>
        <p>6. DNS: This website is hosted using Azure DNS configured to take reuqests from my domain wmbj.ca hosted on Web Hosting Canada This allows my custom URL to function correctly, www.wmbj.ca. DONE</p>
        <p>7. Javascript: I will later on attempt to create a tracker that displays the total number of users who have visited this site. The HTML page will use Java to pull that number from a back end Database. IN PROGRESS
        <p>8. Database: The databae will come into play once I start attemtping to code the site visitor tracker. The counter will be stored in a Cosmo DB Tables instance and called with an API. IN PROGRESS</p>
        <p>9. API: All calls to the database will be done via API</p>
        <p>10. Python: The Azure function to track when a user visits mt website, and update the database counter accordingly will be written in Python. IN PROGRESS</p>
        <p>11. Tests: Python code will support the use of Jest Test Cases. IN PROGRESS</p>
        <p>12. Infra as Code: All Code, the Azure Functions as well as the website itself, will be hosted on github and deployed using actions to mimic a CI/CD development envrionment. IN PROGRESS</p>
